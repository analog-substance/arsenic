description: Manage scope for your network based projects

## Synopsis

Scoper can help you manage the scope of network projects by:

- Automatically detecting and separating IP addresses or domains
- Ensuring an item is in the scope of your engagement
- Keep track of multiple scope for your engagement

To use, simply supply your scope as arguments to scopious add

	scopious add example.com example.net 203.0.113.0/24
	cat scope.txt | scopious add

By default scope is stored in ./scope/external/. This scan be changed by specifying -s

	scopious add -s internal evil.corp internal.corpdev 10.0.0.1/24

You can exclude things from scope as well

	scope excluded admin.example.com 203.0.113.0/29

Scoper can validate items are in scope

	cat maybe-inscope.txt | scopious prune > inscope.txt

Need to view your scope data, scopious can show you all your scope in various ways

List in scope domains
	scopious domains

list in scope root domains
	scopious domains -r

list in scope ips
	scopious ips

expand cidrs and remove excluded things
	scopious ips -x

list excluded things
	scopious exclude -l
